For library designers you can use package objects:

package com.example

package object json {
  class JSONObject { ... }
  def fromString(string: String): JSONObject = { ... }
}

- The file must be named package.scala and is located in the same package
  directory as the package object it is defining.

  Parameterized types:

  What does List[+A] mean?

  List[B] is a subtype of List[A] for any B that is a subtype of A. This is
  called covariance.

To use or not to use parentheses for a function with zero arguments? The
convention is to omit parentheses for pure functions, i.e. functions that have
no side effects, and to include parentheses for functions that have side
effects.

By-name parameters

def foo[T](x: => T) = x

Evaluation of x is deferred until its use. It is also evaluated every time it is
used.

Scala enums! They are available throught the scala standard library.

object Breed extends Enumeration {
  type Breed = Value
  val doberman = Value("Doberman")
  val yorkie   = Value("Yorkshire")
  val scottie  = Value("Scottish")
  ...
}

import Breed._

...

Note you don't actually need human readable strings for your values:

object WeekDay extends Enumeration {
  type WeekDay = Value
  val Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
}
import WeekDay._

Note that case classes are usually used in place of Scala enumerations.

Scala trait mixins:
Use the `with` keyword
